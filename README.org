#+description: Summon my Fedora setup on your machine.

* Description

This repo hosts my shell scripts to setup a usable system in a fresh Linux
Fedora install.  For now it's far from complete, as it installs only a few
packages. But it's gorgeous, at least.

* Instructions

Make =run.sh= executable with =chmod +x run.sh=, then run it with =./run.sh=.

* Disclaimer

It's my personal setup, so it must fit my usage before everyone else's. Given
that, every kind of suggestion is welcome and appreciated.

* To-Do's

- [ ] Flatpacks;
- [ ] Add repos;
- [ ] Dotfiles;
